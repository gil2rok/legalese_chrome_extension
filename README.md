# Legalese Chrome Extension

## About

We all want privacy. Unfortunately, we often sign that away without even knowing it, by agreeing to sketchy TOS or EULAs.

To help, we decided to create the "Legalese Translator" â€” a simple Chrome extension to help you know how worried you should be. It scans the text of a company's Terms of Service agreement for phrases indicating they are violating a user's privacy. This list is curated from recommendations of a privacy-focused non-profit that have spent dozens of man hours reading through Terms of Service agreements.

## Instructions

This chrome extension has not been published to the official chrome extension store. However, one can get a beta version up and running as follows:

To install, simply download as a .zip and upload as a Chrome extension at Chrome://extensions.

To use, click the extension on the webpage you'd like to analyze.
