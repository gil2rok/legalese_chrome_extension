# Legalese-for-Chrome-2

## About

We all want privacy. Unfortunately, we often sign that away without even knowing it, by agreeing to sketchy TOS or EULAs.

To help, we decided to create the "Legalese Translator" — a simple Chrome extension to help you know how worried you should be.

## Instructions

To install, simply download as a .zip and upload as a Chrome extension at Chrome://extensions.

To use, click the extension on the webpage you'd like to analyze.
